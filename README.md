Works with open networks. Not tested with WPA/WEP WPA2 and so on yet. Only tested as stattion. Idk if the hardware can support hostap mode. 
Still work in progress firmware load is a bit unstable. Detaching and reattaching the device physcially to the usb port seems to help in my case.
~~Nothing works as of now in this repo. I have some not committed progress, where the firmware loads and it can scan, and associate to open networks~~
